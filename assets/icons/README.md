# CamCtrl Icons

This directory contains the application icons for CamCtrl.

## Required Files

- `camctrl.png` - 256x256 pixel PNG icon (needs to be created)
- `camctrl.svg` - Scalable vector icon (placeholder provided)
- `camctrl.ico` - Windows icon format (for future Windows support)

## Creating the PNG Icon

The PNG icon should be:
- 256x256 pixels minimum
- Simple, recognizable camera symbol
- Works well at small sizes (16x16) and large sizes (256x256)
- Professional appearance suitable for application launcher

You can:
1. Use the SVG as a base and export to PNG at 256x256
2. Use free icon resources (e.g., from flaticon.com, icons8.com)
3. Create a custom design

## Note

The current `camctrl.svg` is a placeholder. Replace it with a proper camera icon design before release.
